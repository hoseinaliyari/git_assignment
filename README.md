a. What is an issue?
    
    issue is something similar to sumbiting a ticket or a to-do activity.

b. What is a pull request?

    pull request sounds a little confusing as pulling in git is basically receiving information from github but pull request is like asking for permission to merge changes (send information to github) into a branch.

c. Describe the steps to open a pull request?

    head to a repository main page, switch to the pull request tab (third one on top), click on the green button "new pull request", configure the working branch and the upstream branch changes are going to be merged to, wait for results.

d. Describe the steps to add a collaborator to a repository (share write permissions)

    use first icon on the vertical menu on left "collaborators" , after heading to the setting tab of a repository, click on the green button "add people" then look for the desired account through the search bar.

e. What is the difference between git and GitHub?

    git is a general tool or system specially designed for version control, mainly computer programs. github is a website which uses git and also provides GUI on its website to manipulate the git repositories as compared to something like git bash or cmd.

f. What does git diff do?

    is used to see what changes have been made to the files of the branch or repository compared to previous version or commit, to have a better understanding prior to commiting changes.

g. What is the main branch?

    main branch is where the main copy of files are. it is where probably the developed version of the code is running and by creating other branches upstreaming to the main branch, developers have the chance to work on differnt features without any interference with each other or the main branch before merging.

h. Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes directly into the main branch?

    as stated above, that's not a good idea, keeping the main branch intact before reaching a certain point of confidence about the work done is crucial. say you are working on a new feature or trying to solve a bug, if you don't do the task thoroughly and merge into the main branch, not only your feature or bug is not addressed, but you also might create new bugs and problems to other functioning parts of the program.
